Understanding Stock Analysis
Stock analysis is a method for investors and traders to make buying and selling decisions. By studying and evaluating past and current data, investors and traders attempt to gain an edge in the markets by making informed decisions.

Technical Analysis
The second method of stock analysis is technical analysis. Technical analysis focuses on the study of past and present price action to predict the probability of future price movements. Technical analysts analyze the financial market as a whole and are primarily concerned with price and volume, as well as the demand and supply factors that move the market.
Charts are a key tool for technical analysts as they show a graphical illustration of a stockâ€™s trend within a stated time period. For example, using a chart, a technical analyst may mark certain areas as a support or resistance level. The support levels are marked by previous lows below the current trading price, and the resistance markers are placed at previous highs above the current market price of the stock. A break below the support level would indicate a bearish trend to the stock analyst, while a break above the resistance level would take on a bullish outlook.

Standard Deviation : Standard deviation is a number used to tell how measurements for a group are spread out from the average (mean), or expected value i.e, what is the percentage that inverstors will be surprised by the result.
